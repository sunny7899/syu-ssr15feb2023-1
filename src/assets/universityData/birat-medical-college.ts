Also they are recognized by some of the big names like NMC and WHO. Thus Birat Medical College is also named as one of the best option for Indian students.</p><p>BMC Nepal is in a position to offer patients who need treatment for more than one condition, sickness, or disease specialist medical care. This is a result of the distinct convenience of having all the specialist departments under one roof and the close communication and cooperation between these departments. Additionally, the college has a system by which it exposes all consultants by routinely sending them to different national and international conferences, symposiums, and specialised training abroad. It helps them acquire the most current knowledge and skills in their respective fields to provide top-notch medical care to all patients visiting the institution.</p><p>MBBS at Birat Medical College is offered in 6 years including 1 year of internship at a very low cost of average Rs. 4.71 lacs annually.
