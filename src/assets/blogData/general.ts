One of its most significant tasks, even so, is to provide recognition to universities. This indicates that higher education institutions are categorized as universities only if they are rooted under some Central or State Act and are acknowledged by the UGC.</p> <p>The University Grant commission functions according to the conditions noted in the <a href="https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/upload_document/ugc_act.pdf" target="_blank">University Grants Commission Act, 1956.</a> This Act claims to all the universities in India.</p> <p><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1221603/" target="_blank">Section 3</a> of this Act states that the UGC can suggest the Government to announce any other higher education college (which is not a university), to be a Deemed University. And this gets us to the meaning of the phrase.</p><p>A Deemed University is simply an institution that delivers high standards in a distinct region of study and, because of this, is deemed to be a university by the Central Government upon the guidance of the UGC. This position helps such institutions to enjoy the same advantages and honors that are open to any other university in the nation.</p>'
