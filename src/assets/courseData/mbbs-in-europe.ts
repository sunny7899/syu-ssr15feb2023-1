Whether in terms of security concerns, quality education, the European countries has been listed on top position.<p>Therefore, nowadays the MBBS in Europe has become the best choice for Indian students.

Also, the cut-off score is very high so it is difficult to get admission in Indian Medical universities. But, as compared, European universities have been charged less tuition fees from international students. So, it is quite worthy & cost-effective for Indian students."
